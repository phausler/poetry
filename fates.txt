I wish from my mind I could pluck, 
a most splendorous and sublime dream. 
Wrapped up in a warm blanket:
Luck be a fickle fate. 

Ah, but for one moment to abate...
my head gently resting on Clotho's bosom. 
As if dream may be yet real, 
I am reminded of my appeal!
Oh why do you taunt me Lachesis?

"Let my thread find another,
to vibrate as if plucked for a musical harmony."

Narry any solice do I find,
except that in my own accord;
I am the one who binds!

To be bound and strown,
cast aside and moan:
"Why do you taunt me o'fates?!"

A simple night or a paragon of what might
be just a matter of chance,
I wish for reason this circumstance
be brought to light.

For luck be a fickle fate.
Atrops you seem to adore the simple cord
as if to spite me.
All I wish to do is merit the wish
to make another sing in harmony

But narry a single solice I find,
except in my own accord;
I am the one who binds.

We all blame good time
per chance of a moment
to capture a note that sings.
For luck is what happiness brings.
