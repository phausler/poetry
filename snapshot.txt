A brief snapshot of the universe
Expanding the slices of time
My soul resides in the space between

Boundless and timeless
I just want to capture this moment
But I wont let just anyone take my soul

The most fundamental piece
I just want to build this moment
But I wont let just anyone take my soul

If you can marvel at any moment
The majesty of what wont let
You see beyond

Every slice, every fraction
A brief history of time trapped
In the space between

Every slice, every fraction
The brief history of us trapped
In the space bewteen

For a brief moment we can switch
The frames of the movie can be stiched
So I can see though your eyes

If you know what I mean
My soul resides in the space between
