The power of a word can never be fully wrought. 
If I told you how I really felt, what would it sound like?
Would the world sing as a symphony,
or would it be a cacophony?
We all have been taught from birth
The inadequate vernacular of speech
From our first words to our last
We can never make an utterance leaves our lips 
that can capture the sublime nature of a kiss

Some are driven to paint, 
some are driven to place pen to paper; 
all in a quest to rise above our limitations.
To capture what it is like for two souls to meet
Be it a masterpiece of marble or a bronze capturing a moment,
how can we ever compare to that which cannot be complete?

Does a word encompass the feelings of joy
or the feelings of bittersweet?
Or can it do justice to the feeling of the warmth laying next to you?
I could spend the rest of my life trying to capture it
and still feel that words would come up short.

History has shown that for the lack of a better word
armies have been raised, wars have been faut,
great beauty has been forged,
and even images of great serenity have been captured.
We are all prisoners of language. 

Yet we try as we might to place that lightning into a bottle,
as if some great message to wash upon someone else’s shore
No matter how many times I say it (or don’t)
I still will hunger for more
It is in the pursuit of finding the words that satiates me
And no matter how many keystrokes I make
that hunger will most definitely never abate
