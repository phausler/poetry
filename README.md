#Premise
Some call me an engineer. As flattering as that mark of respect may be,
I consider myself an artist first. So this is my geeky way of sharing
some of my musings and things that I write.

#You
You can think of any references to `you` as referring to you, perhaps it
is not. Most often it is more of a reflection of what my mind wanders to.


#License
As it is likely the most apropos license, any commits are held under the
Artistic 2.0 license.
