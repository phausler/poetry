You don't know it yet but we are in a race together
Racing to a finish that may never
Become anything that would be considered a win
Racing, racing to the end

It's a human race condition
            A human race condition
                       Condition

I don't know but I'd bet that we could ever
Be that far apart for a clever
Exploitation of some critical region
Racing, racing to our goals

It's a human race condition
            A human race condition
                       Condition

Could we ever not be in
A race together
Could we ever have the chance
To discover
That what we are doing is just the same
That joining would never wait
That no return is our fate

We are in a race together
